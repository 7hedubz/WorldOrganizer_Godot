# WorldOrganizer_Godot

This program is designed to assist in organization of information of any kind. 

I wrote it with the intent to use it as a world-building tool in order to best keep track of my world and change it on the fly during gameplay. 

The controls are simple, in the first panel you have a tree, type the desired name, and then create your item by pressing the button, or the Enter key.

Then, if you select the newly created item, you can create a new item childed to the currently selected item. In order to unselect items simply click 
    anywhere in empty space beneath the items, or right click any item and select the "Unselect Item" option. 
    
Once selected, you can create Categories for each item (In the third panel, these could be like the type of government a city would have, or the items an NPC is carrying. Your 
    imagination and orginzational skills are your only limit.
    
Then, you can create a hyperlink between any two items by adding a relationship. Simply right click an item, select "Create a Relationship with ..." and double click another item.
    You can now give that relationship a description within each item (unique to that item), as well as double click the relationship in the 3rd panel to jump directly to the 
    related item! An excellent real time reference tool while sitting down at the table (In case you forgot how the king likes to take his coffee, or the name of that one random
    NPC wandering around town)
    
You can also give a second "name" to your items by double clicking the empty space to the right in the item's bar, it could be a descriptor, or a last name. However it is 
    you want to organize your data. The sky's the limit!
    

There are a number of Quality of Life updates I plan on adding to this program, which I will list below in priority order, but as I'm working on this alone I cannot promise
    any time-frame in which you will get them. 
    
    Please please please if you have *any* questions, feedback, or really really feel like I should hurry up on one of these Quality of Life upgrades because you find yourself
    having trouble or wasting your time because of it's current implementation, please find me on the Discords, I'm 7heDubz#1975 and I check my 
    messages often =)
